## Biomechanical Analysis of Javelin throw using IMU_sensor_data

## Project 1: A study on Javelin throw anaylsis using Inertial Measurement Units: Application Development (https://github.com/Ash1708/IMU_sensor_data/tree/main)

### In this project, I have analysed the technical parameters of Javelin throw and ploted the EDA and checked the reliability of the IMU system, further developed into an application.

* Parameters analysed : Stance duration, Stride time, Stride lenght, Throw acceleration, 
*	Identified key performance parameters through comprehensive literature reviews.
* Data collection and processing using Inertial measurement Units (Xsens suit), force plates, motion capture systems (Vicon), and Optogait for athletes of different experience levels.
* Conducted reliability and validity testing of the Xsens system.
* Applied statistical methods to interpret performance data and developed visualizations, reports for publication.
* Collaborated in developing a real-time feedback application to enhance daily training sessions for javelin throw athletes.


## Project 2: Pressure-Measuring-Insoles: Characteristics of plantar loads in maximum forward lunges using pressure measuring insoles (https://github.com/Ash1708/Pressure-Measuring-Insoles/tree/main)
### RESEARCH QUESTION 
To compare the characteristics of plantar loads in maximum forward lunges with pressure 
measuring insoles. 
#### Aim of the study 
To find and compare the peak pressure of five anatomical parts of the right foot namely forefoot, midfoot, heel, lateral and medial parts while performing maximum forward lunges in stable and 
unstable ground conditions by utilizing Medilogic pressure measuring Insoles.
#### Participants: 
A total of ten participants both men and women (age 26 ± 6 years, height 165 ± 15cm, body mass 70 ± 10kg) joined in the test with a shoe size ranges from 37 to 45 in Vicon’s lab at the 
university. All the participants reported that they were in generally good physical condition. 

#### Results:
No Significant Difference in Forefoot Peak Pressure
Significant Differences in Midfoot, Heel, Lateral, and Medial Regions
Heel Region Experiences Maximum Pressure in Stable Ground
Large effect sizes were observed for peak pressure differences in midfoot, heel, lateral, and medial regions, confirming significant variations between stable and unstable conditions.

## Project 3: Effect of external loads on the jump height and force-time characteristics during counter movement jump (https://github.com/Ash1708/Counter-Movement-Jump)

### In this project, I have analysed the effect that external load has on the jump height and force-time characteristics during counter movement jump. 
### RESEARCH QUESTION 
To quantify the effect that barbell load has on kinetic variables during counter movement jump.
#### Participant: One individual (age 26, mass 80kg and height 176cm) volunteered to participate in the experiment. The subject had at least 1 year of resistance training experience and was participating in a structured strength and conditioning program as part of the ongoing personal training.

#### Data processing: All the component of the ground reaction force was recorded by software. Three trials of each CMJ were performed and the jump with best height was analyzed. The variables analyzed during this experiment are Jump height, Propulsion and Landing Impulse, Average force generation during propulsion and landing phases, Propulsion and Landing duration. Data acquisition and analysis of the 
jumps were performed using Excel. Impulse momentum method is used to calculate the jump height and other mentioned parameters. Graphs were plotted for the comparison and assessment of 
kinetic variables

### Result: 
Jump Height Decreases with Increased Load:
Increase in Propulsion and Landing Impulse:
Propulsion impulse increased slightly with each added load, leading to a decrease in average net force and an increase in propulsion duration. Landing impulse increased, but the reduction in average net force was outweighed by the longer landing time.
The longer force application duration suggests that incrementally loaded jumps do not inherently increase injury risk but may alter movement strategies. Increased hip and knee flexion could be a compensatory mechanism to absorb greater forces during landing.

Training and Practical Implications:
From a strength and conditioning perspective, monitoring an athlete’s ability to jump higher in less time with the same load could indicate improved force application capacity.
Practitioners using incremental loading protocols should closely observe landing strategies to mitigate potential injury risks.

## Machine learning and Analytics Project

## Project 4: Classification of Elite and Sub Elite Goalkeepers in professional men’s football using multiple machine learning algorithms (https://github.com/Ash1708/Classification-of-Goalkeepers_ML)

### This is the Machine Learning project I did during my Internship to classify goalkeepers based on their level of expertise using Machine learning Algorithms.


* Data was taken from several elite European leagues over five seasons (2013/2014–2017/2018) obtained from Opta Sports.
* Used Random undersampling to deal with class imbalance.
* Algorithms used:  Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost using scikit-learn
* Evaluation:  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* Documented methodologies, generated visualizations, and provided actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.


## Project 5: Vertical Play - Evaluating Market value of elite midfielders based on their ability to play vertical pass (https://github.com/Ash1708/Vertical-Play_Market-value-evaluation-of-soccer-players)

Research Question : To evaluate the vertical passing abilities of elite midfield soccer players using the metrics verticality and depth and investigate the correlation with market value.
Data Collection   : The dataset for this study included Opta event data from 282 matches of the top French soccer league (Ligue 1) in season 2020/21, which provides the match sheet and detailed contextual information at the time of each event.

Result             : The current study demonstrates that true midfielders and offensive midfielders exhibit a positive correlation between market value and the two metrics, verticality and depth. Further                         analysis indicates that this correlation is particularly strong for players over 24 years old. for wing midfielders, there is a positive correlation between age and market value. This can                     be attributed to the age distribution of different types of midfielders.


## Project 6: Exploratory Data Analysis of football player data_EA Sports (https://github.com/Ash1708/Exploratory-Data-Analysis_Football_Players/tree/main)

### This was a part of my personnal project to explore EDA

* Visualizations, summary statistics, Identifying and imputing missing data and checked for data quality problems.
* Comparisons of various stats between players of similar playing positions.


## Project 7: Effects of Constrained small sided games on physical & technical variables on University football Players (https://github.com/Ash1708/Soccer_Player_Analysis_GPS)

#### Research Question : Does the manipulation of constraints in football SSG has any effect on physical & technical performances of University football players.

* Data Collection : Wimu PRO GPS devices
* Constraints : a. Game mute condition (Players can not communicate verbally among themselves)
                b. Game rectangle condition : In the middle of the pitch there is a rectangle dimensioned 3mx2m.
                c. Normal with no constraints.
